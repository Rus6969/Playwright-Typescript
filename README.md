Welcome to the Playwright TypeScript framework with a Page Object Model (POM) repository! This framework provides a robust structure for building clean and maintainable end-to-end web tests using Playwright and TypeScript. Whether you are new to Playwright or TypeScript, or you're looking to streamline your existing test automation projects, this framework has you covered.

## Features

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement a structured approach for better test script organization and maintenance.
- **Playwright Integration**: Utilize Playwright's powerful web automation capabilities to write and run tests.
- **TypeScript**: Benefit from TypeScript's static typing and improved code quality.
- **Clean and Scalable Code**: Create reusable Page Objects and maintainable test scripts.
